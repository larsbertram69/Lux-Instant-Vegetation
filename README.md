# Lux Instant Vegetation
Lux Instant Vegetation consists of a set of shaders which add high quality procedural wind animations to pretty much any tree or bush mesh - almost instantly and without the need to bake bending information.  
In case you want to improve the final result the shaders also support baked bending information from a bunch of different sources.

Lux Instant Vegetation shaders are authored using Shader Graph. Supported render pipelines are URP and HDRP starting with Unity 2022.3.x. THe core features however are written as HLSL includes so you may be lucky to port it back to older versions of Unity if needed.
